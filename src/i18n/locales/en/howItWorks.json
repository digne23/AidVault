    {
      "question": "Why 6 months?",
      "answer": "The 6-month period helps you build a meaningful savings habit while accumulating enough to make a real impact. It also allows us to batch donations for maximum efficiency, reducing administrative costs and ensuring more of your contribution reaches children in need."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why 20%?",
      "answer": "The 20% commitment is designed to be impactful yet sustainable. It allows you to save for your own goals while making a significant contribution to education. Many of our users find this balance motivating—you're building your future while investing in someone else's."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does my donation go?",
      "answer": "100% of your donation goes to educational supplies and materials for children in need. We work with verified partner schools and organizations in 15+ countries. Every donation is tracked, and you'll receive updates on the specific impact your contribution made."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I donate more than 20%?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! When you reach your 6-month milestone, you can choose to donate anywhere from 20% up to 100% of your savings. Many users choose to give more when they're able, and every additional amount makes a bigger difference."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I withdraw my savings?",
      "answer": "Yes, your money is always yours. However, we encourage you to complete the 6-month cycle to maximize your impact. If you need to withdraw early, you can do so at any time, though the 20% commitment would apply to future savings cycles."

      "question": "Is my money safe?",
